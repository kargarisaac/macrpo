# MACRPO: Multi-Agent Cooperative Recurrent Policy Optimization

Folders:

-   experiments: The code for our method. It also contains the code for [MADDPG](https://github.com/openai/maddpg) baseline method.
-   [dd0_aamas2021](https://github.com/deepdrive/deepdrive): DeepDrive-Zero environment.
-   [multiagent-particle-envs](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs): Environments from [MADDPG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02275.pdf). We modified one of them and used it in MACRPO.
-   [parametersharingmadrl](https://github.com/parametersharingmadrl/parametersharingmadrl): the code for baselines used in our paper from [Revisiting Parameter Sharing In Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13625).
